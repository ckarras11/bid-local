# Bid Cape Cod

This app is a hobby project that I am working on in my spare time. The end goal is to have an app that allows users to bid on items from their community and then pick them up if they have the winning bid. So far I have implemented some of the layout as well as JWT authentication.

## Technologies

1. React
2. Redux
3. JWT
4. MongoDB
5. Node.Js/Express
6. Cloudinary

## Things to do

1. Add testing in Jest to client side
2. Test server with mocha, chai, jest
3. Finishing building out client side (profile, bidding functionality)
4. Figure out deployment
