			<h3>What is Bid Cape Cod?</h3>
			<p>
				Bid Cape Cod is a solution for local autions and sales. Instead of
				listing an item to a local group on a first come first serve basis, list
				it on Bid Cape Cod to make the most from selling your stuff. This gives
				all buyers an equal opportunity to purchase something. If they want it
				bad enough they can pay for it. This way they get the item they want and
				you get the most for it!
			</p>
			<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
			<p>
				To list an item or browse items for sale simply create an account (it's
				free!). From here you will be redirected to the browse page to see all
				items currently for sale. To post an item simply go to the profile page,
				click "Sell Something", upload a picture, fill out the form and submit.
				Make sure to include contact information so buyers can contact you.
			</p>
			<h3>Do I need to pay for it?</h3>
			<p>
				At the moment Bid Cape Cod is completley free. Since the service is free
				you are limited on the number of pictures you can upload. In the future
				this may change depending on use.
			</p>
			<h3>What is the future of this app?</h3>
			<p>
				This was made as a project for fun. If people happen to start using it
				then I will begin maintaining and implementing new features.
